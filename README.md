===============

suit of tools to assist dyslexsics use their strengths in a professional enviroment

currently there is only 1 tool and it is still in development. The idea behind it is to have a basic 3D renderer that will have basic shapes, a line to connect them all and the ability to attach text to them. Dyslexsics think in 3 dimensional enviroments, the aim of this tool to give the dyslexsic a renderer to display their idea in a way that others can easily understand.
